			Welcome to the personal website of Rick Satomi. This website is a collection of my visualization projects, past and ongoing. I am currently a Forest Advisor with the <a href = "http://ceshasta.ucanr.edu/Forestry/"> University of California Cooperative Extension </a>.

			My interests lie in developing interactive data visualizations to improve understanding of the complex interactions between our everyday lives and natural forest resources.  Much of my work is focused on identifying innovative ways to present complex ecological concepts in a more digestible format. I am currently developing a framework to assess costs associated with wood biomass removal as a means to enable ongoing mitigation efforts within overstocked forest stands. See my <a href="/project">projects</a> page for more detail on some past work.
