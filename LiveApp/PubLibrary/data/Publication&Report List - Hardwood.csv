Evaluating the survival of Phytophthora ramorum in Firewood,In this follow-up project we specifically analyzed the survival of Phytophthora ramorum in firewood as it was thoroughly air-dried (seasoning) to a final moisture content of 15% MC. The aim was to evaluate the risk of spreading SOD through the distribution of firewood and fuel wood.,Hardwood,SOD,https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzwsVf_VMR5JV2duWjhIUDREa2s
