			Welcome to the personal website of Rick Satomi. This website is a collection of my visualization projects, past and ongoing. I am currently a Staff Research Associate with the <a href = "ucanr.edu/woodybiomass"> UC Forest Products Laboratory </a> and Master of Forestry Candidate at UC Berkeley. Prior to 2013, I had completed my undergraduate degree in Forest Management and worked for various forest landowners throughout California.

			My interests lie in developing interactive data visualizations to improve understanding of complex interactions between our everyday lives and natural forest ecosystem resources.  Much of the work I am inovled with is focused on presenting known information in a more digestible format for a general audience. I am currently developing a framework to assess costs associated with wood biomass removal as a means to enable ongoing mitigation efforts within overstocked forest stands. See my <a href="/project">projects</a> page for more detail on some past work.
