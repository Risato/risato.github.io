						Staff Research Associate with the UC Forest Products Laboratory and Master of Forestry Candidate at UC Berkeley.

						My interests lie in the development of interactive data visualizations to increase understanding of the complex interactions we have with forest ecosystems and resources.  Much of the work I have am inovled with includes taking known information and presenting it in a more digestible format for a general audience. I am currently working on a framework to assess costs associated with wood biomass removal as a means to help mitigate the ongoing issues with overstocked forest stands. See my <a href="/Project">projects</a> page for more detail on some past work.
